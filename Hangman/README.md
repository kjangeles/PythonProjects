In this basic hangman game created in python, the user is shown the number of letters there are in the word as well as
how many attempts are left. If the user input a number, a char, more than one letter, or pressed enter prematurely then the user 
will be prompted that their input is invalid. The user is also given a choice to either quit early by typing 'give up'or
guessing until game over. Game over is reached when the user runs out of attempts while there is still at least on blank
space left to guess. If the user reached game over the user is asked if they want to continue playing or if they want to
entirely quit the game. Likewise if the user won, meaning there are no more blank spaces left while there is at least
one more attempt left, then are asked to continue playing or to quit. Another interactive part of this game in the inclusion
of the hangman diagram. The more guesses the user get wrong the more the hangman diagram gets completed.
